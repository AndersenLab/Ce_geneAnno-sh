# Misc. scripts...
This directory was created for the initial analyses of creating a gene-based pangenome. It has quickly turned into a repository for storing all scripts related to genome assembly, gene annotation, SV calling, GFF/FA file manipulation, functional enrichment analysis, gene set visualization, and syntelog decompression.
