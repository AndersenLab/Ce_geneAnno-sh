This repository contains the scripts used to assess PAVs and CNVs amoong Caenorhabditis elegans wild strains using PacBio HiFi assemblies. Additionally, we create a pangenome gene set where genes are classified as "core", "soft-core", "rare", or "private" based on the frequency at which they occur in wild strains.
